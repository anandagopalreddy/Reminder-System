# Reminder-System
This project is a fully functional Reminder System API built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, designed to let users create, view, update, and snooze reminders. It supports customizable snooze durations—weeks, days, hours, and minutes—stored as a JSON object in the database. The system includes robust input validation using Pydantic, detailed logging, and clean error handling. Users can interact with the API through auto-generated Swagger documentation, and the backend is organized using SQLAlchemy ORM, Alembic for migrations, and Uvicorn for running the app. It also follows strict Flake8 code style guidelines and includes unit testing for all major functionality. The architecture is clean, modular, and well-suited for both production and educational use.
